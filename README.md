👋 Hello and welcome to my repository documenting the journey of my AI/ML internship with Edunet Foundation, secured through the AICTE Internship Portal. This space serves as a digital diary of my four-week hands-on experience in building a deep learning-based solution in the field of waste classification.

Throughout this internship, I’ve worked on a project that combines environmental awareness with artificial intelligence — applying advanced machine learning techniques to support automated garbage classification.

📌 Internship Snapshot

Domain: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Duration: Four Weeks
Organization: Edunet Foundation
Project Focus: Image-based Garbage Classification using Transfer Learning

🧠 Project Insight

Our modern world generates an overwhelming amount of waste — and sorting it efficiently is crucial for a sustainable future. My project tackles this issue by developing a smart image classification model that can recognize and categorize various types of trash from photographs.

Using the EfficientNetV2B2 architecture, enhanced through transfer learning, I’ve built a model capable of distinguishing between items like paper, plastic, glass, cardboard, and more. The aim is to eventually contribute to systems that assist in real-time waste sorting and recycling.

🎯 Core Objective

To create a high-performance image classifier for waste categories by fine-tuning a pre-trained deep learning model. The system should help in automatic waste segregation and can be integrated into larger recycling or smart bin systems in the future.

🗂️ Dataset Overview

Title: Trash Type Image Dataset
Source: Kaggle – Farzad Nekouei’s Dataset
Summary: A well-labeled collection of images featuring different types of garbage. This dataset includes categories such as cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and general trash. It’s ideal for building supervised learning models aimed at waste classification tasks.

🌱 Why This Matters

This project isn’t just about learning deep learning — it’s about applying it to solve a problem that matters. By building a model that classifies garbage types accurately, I’m contributing (even in a small way) to technologies that could promote better recycling and cleaner urban environments.
