👋 Welcome to my internship progress repository for the Edunet AI/ML Internship. I secured this opportunity through the AICTE Internship Portal. This repository serves as a complete record of my four-week journey in the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning domain. It includes code, notebooks, reports, and weekly updates on the project assigned during the internship.

📌 Internship Overview

Domain: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Duration: 4 Weeks
Organization: Edunet Foundation
Project Title: Garbage Classification using Transfer Learning

🧠 Project Summary

The goal of this project is to develop an AI-powered waste classification system that can assist in automatic garbage sorting. By using transfer learning with the EfficientNetV2B2 model, the project focuses on improving the accuracy and efficiency of classifying waste into categories. The model is trained to recognize different types of trash such as cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and general waste.

🎯 Objective

To create a reliable and accurate garbage classification model using deep learning and transfer learning techniques that support automated waste segregation.

🗂️ Dataset Information

Dataset Title: Trash Type Image Dataset
Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/farzadnekouei/trash-type-image-dataset)
Description: This dataset contains labeled images representing different types of trash, which are suitable for supervised training tasks in image classification.

📁 Repository Contents

This repository includes all relevant code used for model development, along with Jupyter notebooks, visualizations, progress logs, and evaluation reports. It represents the practical application of machine learning skills gained during the internship and demonstrates my contribution to solving real-world environmental challenges using AI.
